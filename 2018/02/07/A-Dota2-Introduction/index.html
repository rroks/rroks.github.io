<p><em>This article is going to introduce Dota 2 briefly and is not a tutorial for players. I am just a 3k mmr Dota 2 player.</em></p>
<h1 id="What-is-Dota2"><a href="#What-is-Dota2" class="headerlink" title="What is Dota2"></a>What is Dota2</h1><p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve Corporation. Dota 2 is the stand-sequel to Defence of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community mod created and maintained by some Warcraft 3 players. In Dota 2, there are two opposing teams and each of which has five players. Each team occupies and defends a base architecture, which is called the “Ancient”, on the map. Each player controls a single charactor, which is called “hero” in Dota 2, on the playerground. Heroes have various unique abilities and playing styles. Players control heroes to obtain gold, experience and item and fight with the opposing team. A team wins a match by destroying the opposing Ancient.</p>
<h2 id="Dota-2-Basics"><a href="#Dota-2-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Dota 2 Basics"></a>Dota 2 Basics</h2><p>The elements of Dota 2 will be talked in the following two subsections. One of the subsections is The Game Map in which I simply introduce objects on the battle ground. While the other subsection contains some knowledge about Dota 2 heroes and the item system.</p>
<h3 id="The-Game-Map"><a href="#The-Game-Map" class="headerlink" title="The Game Map"></a>The Game Map</h3><p>The minimap of Dota 2 game map is represented in the following figure.<br>![Minimap_7.07.png] (Minimap_7.07.png)</p>
<p>The bases of two teams are located on opposing corners of the map. The Radiant in on the lower left corner of the map while the Dire is on the upper right corner. Between them, a river seperates these two factions diagonally. There are three paths, which are called “lanes”, connecting the two bases. Each side has several kind of buildings including the Ancient, fountain, tower, barrack, shrine and effigy spreading on the map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each side has one fountain which is the respawn area of the faction and heals friendly units within it. Fountains are indestructible.</li>
<li>The Ancient is inside each faction’s base and is the main target of a Dota 2 game.</li>
<li>Towers will attack any hostile units (including heroes and creeps) nearby. Each side has eleven towers, six of which are on lanes while the rest are in the base.</li>
<li>Every thirty seconds, three groups of computer-controlled units, namely creeps, will be generated near barracks on both two bases and set off towards opposing base along the paths. Heroes can obtain gold and experience by killing these creeps.</li>
<li>Shrines have an ability that can be actived to heal nearby units and has 5 minutes cooldown.</li>
<li>Effigies are just a kind of filler buildings which will cost the enemy more time to reach the Ancients since computer-controlled creeps will attack the most nearby opposing target first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The areas between lanes, which are called “jungles”, have many neutral creeps spreading around. They also provide gold and experience. On the river, there is a pit with a strong creep named Roshan in it. The faction killing Roshan can obtain plenty of gold and experience. Roshan will also drop some useful items. Also, players can find runes which can enhance their hero or give them bounty.</p>
<p>Besides all these buildings and creeps, the terrain varies accross the map. Highgrounds, cliffs and valleys spread around the map. Trees make the map even more complex.</p>
<p>It’s obvious that the map is not fully symmetric which influences the game result indirectly.</p>
<h4 id="The-map-itself-has-been-modified-several-times-Though-it-has-enriched-the-gameplay-the-essence-of-Dota-2-doesn’t-change"><a href="#The-map-itself-has-been-modified-several-times-Though-it-has-enriched-the-gameplay-the-essence-of-Dota-2-doesn’t-change" class="headerlink" title="The map itself has been modified several times. Though it has enriched the gameplay, the essence of Dota 2 doesn’t change."></a>The map itself has been modified several times. Though it has enriched the gameplay, the essence of Dota 2 doesn’t change.</h4><h3 id="Heroes-and-Items"><a href="#Heroes-and-Items" class="headerlink" title="Heroes and Items"></a>Heroes and Items</h3><h4 id="Heroes"><a href="#Heroes" class="headerlink" title="Heroes"></a>Heroes</h4><p>So far in Dota 2 version 7.08, there are 115 heroes available. Heroes can be divided into three categories according to their attributes. Heroes have many properties and abilities, but their primary attribute can only be one of the three attributes, namely strength, agility and intelligence. Generally, a hero’s main attribute will have higher value than the rest main attributes. However, it’s not always the fact. For example, Orge Magi is an intelligence hero but has 3.5 strength growth and 2 intelligence growth per level. Orge Magi’s strength growth is even higher than most of strength heroes! The primary attribute doesn’t limit a hero’s role in their team. The gameplay could more depend more on the players themselves.</p>
<p>These three primary attributes have different affects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Strength</code>: strength increases a hero’s health and health regeneration. To a strength hero, it also provides extra attack damage and status resistance.</li>
<li><code>Agility</code>: agility increases a hero’s armor and attack speed. To an agility hero, it gains extra attack damage and movement speed.</li>
<li><code>Intelligence</code>: intelligence increases a hero’s mana, mana regeneration and spell damage. To an intelligence hero, it proveds extra damage and magic resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides primary attributes, heroes also have properties including: attack damage, attack speed, attack range, attack point, attack backswing, missile speed (ranged heroes only), damage bloack, armor, evasion, magic resistance, turn rate, vision, attack modifier (critical strike, splash, cleave, bash, life steal, mana break, etc), cast animation, spell damage, spell lifesteal, etc.</p>
<p>Heroes also have unique abilities (at least four abilities) and talents.</p>
<p>All these properties, abilities and talents could generally determine a hero’s role in a team (of course players can act as they wish, it depends on the player rather than Dota 2 game developers).</p>
<p>Players can enhance their hero by ganing more experience to level up or more gold to buy useful items.</p>
<h4 id="Items"><a href="#Items" class="headerlink" title="Items"></a>Items</h4><p>Items can only obtain in game and can provide heroes addional attributes and abilities. Some lower tier items can be combined or upgraded into higher tier items. And of course, it takes player’s gold. Some items are consumable that can provide some specific status.</p>
<h4 id="Gold-and-experience"><a href="#Gold-and-experience" class="headerlink" title="Gold and experience"></a>Gold and experience</h4><p>Gold is granted during the game constantly, but can also be obtained by killing hostile units (heroes, creeps, buildings, couriers). Bounty runes can also grant gold and experience.</p>
<p>Experience can be obtained by kill creeps (denying friendly creeps also provides experience) and hostile heroes, comsuming Bounty runes or Tome fo Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a Dota 2 match, the faction the player in and the hero the player choose will effect the match result greatly (we are not goint to disscuss about factors beyond the game).</p>
<p>It’s obvious that different sight can affect players though we don’t do research about how exactly it works. The Dota 2 statistics shows that the Radiant has higher winning rate than the Dire. We fetch this on some Dota 2 statistics websites like [Dotabuff] (www.dotabuff.com).</p>
<p>Besides team composition will also effect the game result. In some patches, some heroes can be slightly stonger that could overwhelm hostile heroes and finally win the game. Some times, the team composition can be quite powerful. It can be advantaged in some expects like tower destorying, early team fight, defense or so. This could also help win a match.</p>
<p>Since players could not choose which faction they belong to, it is crucial to choose heroes that are strong and cooperat well together before the battle. Good picks could make it easier to win a game.</p>
<p>Hope that all of us can enjor this game!</p>
